In addition to the listed damage, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. Chemical blinding agents are ineffective against anyone wearing a full face covering or eye protection. Blinding weapons do not add an ability score bonus to their damage rolls.",
		"Blunted": {
			"Label": "Blunted",
			"Hint": "This condition applies only to weapons and ammunition dealing slashing or piercing damage. Due to a lack of maintenance or malformation, blunted weapons deal half damage (the total damage dealt is halved) unless the wielder has Improvised Equipment proficiency. Remove this condition during a short rest by sharpening the weapon"
		},
		"Burst.Label": "Burst",
		"Burst.Hint": "Weapons with the burst fire property can expend additional ammunition to deal increased damage. The number indicates the number of ammo rounds required.

Burst fire cannot be used at long range.",
		"Deafening.Label": "Deafening",
		"Deafening.Hint": "Deafening weapons use intense noise to temporarily deafen opponents. In addition to any damage, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain the Deafened condition and suffer disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks due to temporary inner ear damage, both for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.",
		"Dirty": {
			"Label": "Dirty",
			"Hint": "This condition only affects mechanical firearms. Dropping a weapon into mud, sand, loose soil, or other similar substances can make a weapon dirty. A dirty weapon temporarily has the Unreliable property, causing it to jam on a critical miss. Cleaning the weapon during a short rest removes this condition."

		},
		"FullAuto.Label": "Full-Auto",
		"FullAuto.Hint": "A full-auto mechanism cocks the gun and loads a new round from the magazine each time a round is fired. The gun fires continuously as long as the trigger is held down. This allows you to use the Suppressive Fire action.",
		"Grenade.Label": "Grenade",
		"Grenade.Hint": "Grenades are explosives designed to be charged and then quickly thrown or launched. They require one hand to throw, and a free hand to arm them.",
		"Heavy.Label": "Heavy",
		"Heavy.Hint": "Heavy weapons are especially large and difficult to wield. Anyone with less than 15 Strength has disadvantage on attack rolls while wielding a heavy weapon. Heavy firearms can be fired without this penalty if they are fired from a stationary position, braced on the ground or a sturdy platform.",
		"Illuminating.Label": "Illuminating",
		"Illuminating.Hint": "This explosive creates a field of bright light within its radius. It is not blinding. It provides illumination for up to 30 minutes.",

		"Improvised.Hint": "These objects are not well suited to be used as weapons. Wielders suffer disadvantage on attack rolls with these weapons unless they have the Improvised Equipment proficiency.",
		"Indirect.Label": "Indirect",
		"Indirect.Hint": " Indirect weapons are almost always some kind of thrown explosive.",

		},
		"Lancing": {
			"Label": "Lancing",
			"Hint": "A lancing weapon is intended for use from horseback as part of a charging attack. If used by a rider mounted on or riding in a vehicle, a successful hit adds one dice of damage so long as the mount or vehicle moves 10 feet or more during their turn."
		},
		"Light.Label": "Light",
		"Light.Hint": " Light weapons are small enough to effectively wield one in each hand.",

		"Loud.Hint": "Loud weapons can be heard up to 2 miles away and are easily detected through building walls.",
		"Masterwork": {
			"Label": "Masterwork",
			"Hint": "Masterwork armor ignores the Awkward property. Melee Masterwork weapons add +1 to damage. Ranged Masterwork weapons do not have disadvantage at long range. Add +1 to the price level of any masterwork armor or weapon."

		"Reach.Hint": "This is the distance at which you can strike an opponent with a melee weapon. Unless otherwise noted, melee weapons have a reach of 5 feet.",
		"Restricted.Label": "Restricted",
		"Restricted.Hint": "This equipment is limited to police and military in most or all of the US, and in many other jurisdictions worldwide. Even where it isn’t properly illegal, when in the hands of anyone but known authority figures, it raises eyebrows and draws attention.",
		"Returning.Label": "Returning",
		"Returning.Hint": "A returning weapon is designed to return to the person throwing it if the attack misses its target. If the thrower rolls a critical miss, the weapon does not return.",
		"SawedOff": {
			"Label": "Sawed Off",
			"Hint": "This condition represents a long-barrel firearm having its barrel cut down to a short length. Once done, the condition is permanent. Quarter the range and long range of the firearm, but reduce the Bulk of the weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1)."
		},
		"SemiAuto.Label": "Semi-Auto",
		"SemiAuto.Hint": "A semi-auto mechanism cocks the gun and loads a new round from the magazine each time a round is fired. Each pull of the trigger fires one bullet.",
		"Shoddy": {
			"Label": "Shoddy",
			"Hint": "A shoddy weapon is one with manufacturing defects, or that has permanent damage from use and no longer works well. Bent blades, damaged sights, and warped wood are all potential sources of the shoddy condition. Shoddy weapons impose disadvantage on all attack rolls made with them. Shoddy weapons cannot be repaired."
		},
		"Shot.Label": "Shot",
		"Shot.Hint": "Shotguns typically fire buckshot rounds that make it easier to hit targets at close range. This weapon has advantage on attack rolls at ranges up to 30 feet.",
		"Shot.NPCHint": "This attack is made at advantage against targets within 30 feet.",
		"SlowFiring.Label": "Slow-Firing",
		"SlowFiring.Hint": "A slow-firing weapon takes significant time to prepare each shot. As a result, you cannot attack more than once during your turn with a slow-firing weapon, even if you have the Advanced Combat Training talent.",
		"Special.Label": "Special",
		"Special.Hint": "This weapon has additional detailed rules listed in its description.",
		"Stationary.Label": "Stationary",
		"Stationary.Hint": "Guns with this property are too large to effectively fire while held. They are fired on the ground, from a platform, or mounted to a vehicle.",
		"Stunning.Label": "Stunning",
		"Stunning.Hint": "Stunning weapons use electrical pulses to temporarily incapacitate opponents. In addition to any electrical damage, a Medium size or smaller target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain the Stunned condition until the end of their next turn. Stunning weapons do not add an ability score bonus to their damage rolls.",
		"Swarm.Label": "Swarm",
		"Swarm.Hint": "",
		"Thrown.Label": "Thrown",
		"Thrown.Hint": "Melee weapons that have the thrown property can be used either for a melee attack or thrown at an opponent as a ranged attack. If thrown, they use the same ability modifier for attack and damage as for a melee attack. Once thrown, it must be recovered before it can be thrown again.",
